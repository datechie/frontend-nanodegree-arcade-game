## What is this?
This is my implementation of the classic Frogger game - for the Udacity FEND project Arcade Game

## Getting Started
Launch the URL - **https://rawgit.com/datechie/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/master/index.html** to start the game. _This game has only been tested in the Google Chrome browser._

## How to play the Game
 - The goal of the game is to move the player from the grass layer at the bottom to the water at the top while passing through the stones
 - The player moves using up, down, left and right arrow keys on the keyboard. Each strokes moves the player one row or column at a time
 - If the player collides with a bug, the player position gets reset to the starting position
 - Once the player reaches the water at the top, the player position resets again so that you can play the game again
